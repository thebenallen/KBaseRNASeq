description : |
    <p>This method allows the users to provide the metadata to set up an RNA-seq experiment</p>
    
    <p>Users need to import single-end or paired-end read files and the corresponding genome and reference genome annotation files to the Data Pane before starting this method.</p>
    
    <p>It is mandatory for users to provide "Experiment Analysis" (RNA-seq analysis output object), select the "Genome", "Reference Genome Annotation", "Library Type", and "Domain" from the drop down menu along with the total number of samples, number of replicates and labels of the sample conditions/treatments. It is necessary to have the same number of replication for each sample.</p>
    
    <p>Users can optionally fill in additional metadata information in the advanced options.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the "Experiment Analysis" object will be updated by the successive methods in the RNA-seq pipeline. This method also associates the input sequence reads with "Experiment Analysis" object to generate "RNA-seq Sample" objects.</p>
   
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
